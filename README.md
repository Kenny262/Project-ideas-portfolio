# My Portfolio 

I have created this GitHub portfolio to further my learning and showcase my journey towards becoming a future quant. Within this portfolio, my aim is to explore various theories in finance and apply my own creative approach to see what I can achieve.

I will mainly be using python and SQL and using machine learning techniques.
